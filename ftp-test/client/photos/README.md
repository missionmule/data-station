All .jpg files in this directory have been `.gitignore`d. If your text editor
does not show the photos in after running the drone FTP client, double check
that your editor is not hiding the photos. To do this, just check the actual
folder on your computer or disable VCS ignored files.

In Atom, do this by going to settings > packages > tree-view > settings and
unchecking "Hide VCS Ignored Files".
