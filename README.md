#### Ordering the Components
Download the latest bill of materials. Follow the Octopart link to the PMC BOM. Order components, choosing vendor according to availability, price and time requirements.

### Enclosure
Download the the latest bill of materials.  Follow the Octopart link to the Data Station Major Component BOM. Order components, choosing vendor according to availability, price and time requirements. Order materials from the Data Tools and Consumables BOM as necessary.

Assemble enclosure? Shien...

## Power Management Firmware
### Requirements
1. Arduino IDE
2. [Adafruit GPS Arduino Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_GPS)

Download the code in the [DataStation](https://github.com/missionmule/data-station/tree/master/DataStation) and compile for "Arduino Pro or Pro Mini". Upload  using an [FTDI Basic Breakout Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716)
